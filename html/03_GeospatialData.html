					<h1>Spatial data analysis</h1>

					<section>
						<h3>Spatial statistics vs Classical statistics</h3>
						<p>There is a fundamental difference
							between classical and spatial statistics. In classical statistics, we make a basic
							assumption regarding the sample: it is a collection of independent observations that follow a specific, usually normal, distribution. Contrariwise, in spatial
							statistics, because of the inherent <strong>spatial dependence</strong> and the fact that <strong>spatial
								autocorrelation</strong> exists (usually), the focus is on adopting techniques for
							detecting and describing these correlations. In other words, in classical statistics, observation independence should exist while, in spatial statistics, spatial
							dependence usually exists. Classical statistics should be modified accordingly
							to adapt to this condition.</p>

							<li>Location...where matters</li>
							<li>Spatial dependence is the rule, not the exception</li>
							<li>Spatial scale...of the process and...of the measurement</li>

					<section>
						<p>Spatial data is geographically referenced data, given at known locations and
							often represented visually through maps. That geographic reference, or the
							location component of the data, may be represented using any number of
							coordinate reference systems, for example, longitude and latitude.</p>
	
						<p>In other words, spatial data is spatially dependent or correlated,
							and independence between the observations, which is a common assumption
							for many statistical techniques, is not satisfied</p>
	
						<p>An observed spatial pattern may be observed in
							variables strictly depending on the location, or because of direct interactions
							between the points.</p>
					</section>
	
					<section>
						<p>Geospatial data is data about objects, events, or phenomena that have a location on the surface of the earth, 
							including location information, attribute information (the characteristics
							 of the object, event, or phenomena concerned), and often also temporal information (the time or life span at 
							 which the location and attributes exist)</p>

					<h1>Problems in spatial data</h1>

					<section>
						<h3>Spatial hetereogenety</h3>
						<p>The results of any analysis over a limited area can be expected to change as 
							that limited area is relocated, and to be different from the results that 
							would be obtained for the surface of the Earth as a whole</p>
							<img src="images/.png" width="400">
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>MAUP</h3>
						<p>The Modifiable Area Unit Problem (MAUP) problem refers to the influence the zone design has on the outcomes of the
							analysis. A different designation would probably lead to different results.</p>
							<img src="images/maup.png" width="400">
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>MAUP</h3>
						<img src="images/maup1.png" width="600">
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>The Edge Effects Problem</h3>
						<p>In the edge effects problem, spatial units
							that lie in the center of the study area tend to have neighbors in all
							directions, whereas spatial units at the edges of the study area have
							neighbors only in some specific directions.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Ecological Fallacy</h3>
						<p>This problem occurs when a relationship that is
							statistically significant at one level of analysis is assumed to hold true at a
							more detailed level as well. This is a typical mistake that occurs when we
							use aggregated data to describe the behavior of individuals. </p>
								<img src="images/fallacy.jpg" width="600">
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Spatial autocorrelation</h3>
						<p>Spatial autocorrelation is a complicated name for the obvious fact that data
							from locations near one another in space are more likely to be similar than
							data from locations remote from one another.</p>

						<p>The existence of spatial autocorrelation is therefore a given in geography.
								Unfortunately, it is also an impediment to the application of conventional
								statistics</p>

						<p> Spatial autocorrelation introduces redundancy into data</p>

			<h1>GIS Data Models</h1>

				<section>
					<p>Spatial data may be of various broad types: points, lines, areas, and
						fields. Each type typically requires different techniques and approaches.</p>
					<img src="images/data.png" width="500">
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>The relationship between real geographic entities and spatial data is
						complex and scale-dependent.</p>

					<h3>Spatial Geometric Operations</h3>
					<img src="images/transformations.png" width="700">
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Types of spatial models</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Object-based (feature) model: </strong>In the object view, we consider the world as a series of entities located in
							space. Entities are (usually) real. An object is a digital representation of all or part of an entity, which can be described in 
							detail according to their boundary lines and other objects that constitute them or are related to them.</li></br>
						<li><strong>Field model: </strong> In the field view, the world consists of properties continuously varying across
							space. It represents data that are considered to be continuously changing in two-dimensional or three-dimensional space.
							In a field, every location has a value (including ‘‘not here’’
							or zero) and sets of values taken together define the field.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>	

			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Object-based model</h1>
			
				<section>
					<h3>Vector</h3>
					<p>objects are frequently not as simple as this geometric view leads
						one to assume. They may exist in three spatial dimensions, move and
						change over time, have a representation that is strongly scale-dependent, relate to entities that are themselves fuzzy and/or have indeterminate boundaries, or even be fractal.</p>

					<h3>Vector</h3>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Shapefile</h3>
					<p>A shapefile is a file-based data format native to ArcView software . 
						Conceptually, a shapefile is a feature class–it stores a collection of features that have the same geometry 
						type (point, line, or polygon), the same attributes, and a common spatial extent.

						Despite what its name may imply, a “single” shapefile is actually composed of at least three files, 
						and as many as eight. Each file that makes up a “shapefile” has a common filename but different extension 
						type.</p>
					<h3>Arc-Info Interchange (e00) </h3>
					<p>An ArcInfo interchange file, is also known as an export file type, this file format is used to enable a coverage, grid or TIN, and an associated INFO table to be transferred between different machines. This file has the .e00 extension.</p>

					
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>File Geodatabase</h3>
					<p>A file geodatabase is a relational database storage format. It’s a far more complex data structure than the 
						shapefile and consists of a .gdb folder housing dozens of files. Its complexity renders it more versatile 
						allowing it to store multiple feature classes and enabling topological definitions. An example of the 
						contents of a geodatabase is shown in the following figure.</p>
						<img src="images/geodatabase.jpg" width="1000">
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>GeoPackage</h3>
					<p>This is a relatively new data format that follows open format standards (i.e. it is non-proprietary). 
						It’s built on top of SQLite (a self-contained relational database). Its one big advantage over many other 
						vector formats is its compactness–coordinate value, metadata, attribute table, projection information, 
						etc…, are all stored in a single file which facilitates portability. Its filename usually ends in .gpkg. 
						Applications such as QGIS (2.12 and up), R and ArcGIS will recognize this format (ArcGIS version 10.2.2 
						and above will read the file from ArcCatalog but requires a script to create a GeoPackage).</p>

				<section>
					<h3><a href="http://geojson.io/">Geojson</a></h3>
					<p>GeoJSON is an Open Standard Format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attribute</p>
					<img src="images/geojson.png" width="900">
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Keyhole Markup Language (KML)</h3>
					<p>XML based file format, used to visualize spatial data and modelling information like lines, shapes, 3D images and points in an Google Earth.</p>
					<h3>Geography Markup Language (GML)</h3>
					<p>It is used in the Open GIS Consortium for storing geographical data in a standard interchangeable format, It is based on XML.</p>
					<h3>SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) </h3>
					<p>It is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics Any program that recognizes XML can display the SVG image.</p>
					<h3>DWG</h3>
					<p>DWG is an intern format for AutoCAD. A DWG file is a database of 2D or 3D drawings.</p>

					<h3>Raster continuo</h3>
					<p>Continuous rasters (non-discrete) are grid cells with gradual changing data such as elevation, temperature or 
						an aerial photograph. A continuous raster surface can be derived from a fixed registration point. For example, 
						digital elevation models use sea level as a registration point. Each cell represents a value above or below sea 
						level.</p>
					<img src="images/conraster.png" width="1000">
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Raster discreto</h3>
					<p>Discrete rasters have distinct themes or categories. For example, one grid cell represents a land cover class 
						or a soil type.In a discrete raster land cover/use map, you can distinguish each thematic class. Each class 
						can be discretely defined where it begins and ends. In other words, each land cover cell is definable and it 
						fills the entire area of the cell. Discrete data usually consists of integers to represent classes.</p>
					<img src="images/disraster.png" width="1000">
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Raster GIS File Format</h3>
					<h3>Imagine</h3>
					<p>The Imagine file format was originally created by an image processing software company called ERDAS. 
						This file format consists of a single .img file. This is a simpler file format than the shapefile. 
						It is sometimes accompanied by an .xml file which usually stores metadata information about the raster layer.</p>
						<h3>GeoTiff</h3>
						<p>A popular public domain raster data format is the GeoTIFF format. If maximum portability and platform 
							independence is important, this file format may be a good choice.</p>
					<h3>Binary file </h3>
							<p>An unformatted file consisting of raster data written in one of several data types, where multiple bands are stored in BSQ (band sequential), BIP (band interleaved by pixel) or BIL (band interleaved by line).</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>USGS DEM</h3>
					<p>USGS DEM — The USGS’ Digital Elevation Model. DEM is a raster format created by the USGS (US Geological Survey) for saving elevation data. Cell values in DEM represent the elevation for that position on the Earth’s surface.</p>
					<h3>GTOPO3O</h3>
					<p>Large complete Earth elevation model at 30 arc seconds, delivered in the USGS DEM format</p>
					<h3>ECW</h3>
					<p>Enhanced Compressed Wavelet (from ERDAS). A compressed wavelet format, often lossy</p>
					<h3>netCDF</h3>
					<p>netCDF file format with The Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata conventions for earth science data. It allows for direct web-access of subsets/aggregations of maps through OPeNDAP protocol.</p>
